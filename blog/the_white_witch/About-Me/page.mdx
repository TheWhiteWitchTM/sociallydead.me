### 🧙‍♀️ About The White Witch™ ✨

Born in the 70s, somehow still looking like I’m perpetually stuck in my 30s. Good genes, better skincare, or just spite—take your pick.

PhD in Computer Science, MSc in Economics. Yes, both. I like collecting expensive pieces of paper that prove I can overthink for a living.

Been fucking around with computers since I was 12. BASIC on a clunky Commodore, then straight into the deep end. Never really stopped.

Same flavour of autism as Elon Musk—high-functioning, pattern-obsessed, zero filter, occasional social Chernobyl. It’s a feature, not a bug.

Hubby to a patient historian who puts up with my chaos. Pagan agnostic: I vibe with the old gods, nature’s rhythms, and the sheer absurdity of existence, but I’m not signing any blood oaths or buying crystals by the kilo. Magic is code that runs on reality’s wetware.

I fucking despise extremism—left, right, doesn’t matter. Both sides eat their own and call it virtue. I’m a sucker for common sense, dry humour, and people who can admit when they’re full of shit.

Here you’ll find unfiltered rants, tech curses, occult-adjacent braindumps, and the occasional victory lap over yet another deployment that almost killed me.

Welcome to the coven. Mind the familiars.
