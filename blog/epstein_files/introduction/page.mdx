#### Trump's Epstein Entanglement: A Guilty Glow-Up?

Oh, darlings, gather 'round my cauldron for this steaming brew of bullshit. Back in the '90s, Trump and Epstein were thicker than thieves at Mar-a-Lago—flying on Lolita Express, Trump gushing in 2002: "Terrific guy, likes 'em young." Fast-forward: fallout over property bids, Trump bans him. But 2019? Epstein busted, Trump claims "not a fan." Classic flip-flop.

Enter election chaos: Trump, campaigning like a cornered cat, vows to "release the Epstein files" if re-elected. Hesitant AF in interviews—stammering, "We'll see, big stuff." Voters ate it up, but honey, he painted himself into a pentagram.

Now? He signed the Epstein Files Act amid pressure, but DOJ's drip-feeding docs with redactions galore. Critics scream non-compliance: over 6M pages ID'd, only half out. Looks guilty as a fox in the henhouse, no? If innocent, why hide? Stay tuned for more hexes in Epstein Files. 🧙‍♀️💀
